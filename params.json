If you are attending several\r\nlectures that day, you would name the files `YYYY-MM-DD{a,b}.tex` and so forth.\r\n\r\nWhen done, don't forget to include the file in `main.tex`. Doing so is easy,\r\njust add:\r\n\r\n    \\input{YYYY-MM-DDa.tex}\r\n\r\nAt the appropriate spot in your main.tex.\r\n\r\n## Localisation\r\n\r\nSwedish hyphenation is used by default. If writing in English, you may want to\r\ntell babel about it. Do so by commenting out the current babel line in\r\n`preamble.tex` and adding one appropriate for your language, e.g.:\r\n\r\n    %\\usepackage[swedish]{babel}\r\n    \\usepackage[british]{babel}\r\n\r\n## Compiling the document\r\n\r\nAssuming you are using Mac OS X or some other Makefile-aware operating system,\r\njust use make:\r\n\r\n    $ make viewpdf\r\n\r\nIf you are using Linux or FreeBSD or similar, you will have to edit the\r\nviewpdf target in the Makefile.\r\n\r\n## Using a bibliography\r\n\r\nIf you need bibliography support, enter your biblatex items into `biblio.bib`\r\nand uncomment the biber line in `Makefile`.\r\n\r\n## Resources\r\n\r\n * [Anton Geraschenko's advice on real-time TeXing](http://stacky.net/wiki/index.php?title=Advice_on_real-time_TeXing).\r\n   Anton's website has also got a section where he provides notes from various\r\n   courses.\r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
